lab 1: feedforward networks [[slide]](https://github.com/txzhao/Artificial-Neural-Networks/blob/master/FeedForwardNetworks/ann-lab1.pdf)
* one-layer-perceptron network
* two-layer-perceptron network

lab 2: RBF networks
* supervised learning of weights (batch learning with least square; online learning with delta rule)
* RBF placement (competitive learning; expectation maximization)

lab 3: self-organizing maps
* data clustering

lab 4: Hopfield networks 
* Hebbian learning
* synchronous and asynchronous pattern update
