# ArtificialNeuralNetworks

lab 1: feedforward networks
* one-layer-perceptron network
* two-layer-perceptron network

lab 2: RBF networks
* supervised learning of weights (batch learning with least square; online learning with delta rule)
* RBF placement (competitive learning; expectation maximization)

lab 3: self-organizing maps

lab 4: Hopfield networks 
* Hebbian learning
* synchronous and asynchronous pattern update
